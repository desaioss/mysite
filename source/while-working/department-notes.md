### Hiring:

-  Select an candidate who is good at all other aspects like aptitude, attitude, communication, but lacking techhnicals due to lack of exposure. During his/her notice
   period, ask to complete certifications around missing skills or skills that add value. Company will reimburse these certifications within first three months if candidate passes those and 
   joins our company as promised. This has multiple advantages :
   - You get candidate who is not fully ready so you can get him/her at reasonable rates.
   - Candidate can use his 2-3 months of notice period in preparation
   - candidate has to pay for certification initially, so there are more chances of him joining our company to get reimbursement
   - we get a chance to groom candidate on the skills that we require even before he/she joins. So, once he/she joins, they can quickly be made productive.
   - **Downside:** As candidate is preparing and getting certificates during notice period, his chances of getting job somewhere else also increases.
 - candidate notes:
    - Good candidates can be found with MNC exposure like 
      - Nilesh: from TCS, 9 yrs, CTC-10LPA, ECTC-14LPA
