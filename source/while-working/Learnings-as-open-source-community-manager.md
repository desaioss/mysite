# As community manager

My learnings"

### About documentation :

There could be three kinds of documentation:
1) Introduction and marketing material
2) Installation guides
3) Configuration guides ( like how to use various configuration option, enable disable features, setup basic usecases )
4) Technical documentation (this is technical documentation of code, modules and architecture)
5) developer documentation (How to setup workspace, run tests, remote debug,Contribution process, guidelines etc)

All of above documentation can also be assisted with video tutorials, FAQs etc

#### Live examples:

On community chat platform (gitter/slack) :
as understood from what 'Pop' user is doing on Falco slack channel.
- welcome new users
- setup community calls ( ones a week ). and send reminders.
- setup and conduct surveys
- respond to tech queries if possible.
- encourage people to appreciate others like this :

### Regular house holding checks :

- stale branches across repos
- (for sometime)Track PR merges and see if they had met quality criteria and let code owner and developer know
- issue triage
- are all the automation successfully running? For example, github actions can fail silently. You have to periodically check their logs to ensure that there are no errors. For instance, one of my github action script was referring to a module in the build command. Later this module was removed from the project and github action script started failing, but nobody knew until a person spotted it. Note: I found out that I was not paying attention to my emails. Github sends email with subject similar to `[JanssenProject/jans-auth-server] Run failed: Code quality check - feature-flags-using-ff4j (276ae10)` in case there is a failure in the action run .
- check automated non-dependabot PRs to be merged on Non-CN repos
- check github notifications 
- PR backlog across all repos and aging PRs
  - backlog should not cross certain number of open PR threshold and aging of PRs shouldn't be more than certain days.


### Useful github automation:

- If you have PRs that get auto generated by bots and then it is a routine task to just merge those PRs then, to automate that routine task, enabling auto merge for repositories and PRs will help. First you'll have to [enable auto merge for repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository) and then configure bot to raise PRs with [automerge enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request).

### Performance parameters for OSS project:
These are metrics and parameters developed by Linux foundation:
- [CII best practice badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en): To ensure that project is following OSS best practices. For health and stregth of engineering process in an OSS project.
- [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) project: to define how healthy your community is. They also have tools that will give you analytics on top of your OSS repo data.
