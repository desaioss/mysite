# Why open-source projects need high quality code

Because of two factors:
- People are not dedicatedly available to work in urgent situations
- And bad code can create such urgent situations like broken builds or production
outages
  
So, bottom line is that since open-source projects don't have people to fix 
something 'right-away', it is better to avoid getting into those situations. And to do that
the best option is to ensure code getting committed is high-quality. Hence, it is very 
importan that an open-source project follow strict checks and balances to make sure that reviews are done, static code
analysis is happening and warnings are being fixed etc etc
