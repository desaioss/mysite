other software like docker etc without registration. For registration, you need registration code. 

How to get registration code:
- you need to have account on suse customer care (scc.suse.com)
- once you have logged into scc.suse.com, go to https://www.suse.com/download/sles/
- at the bottom of the page you'll see a button `get your 60 day trial code`
- click on that and on the next page you can create your registration code for evaluation copy
- Use this code to register your installation
- On your vm follow these steps: https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/cha-register-sle.html#sec-register-sle-system
