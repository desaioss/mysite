IAM:
- IAM is a global service so there is no region to be selected
- first, you create a root account and set up aws account with it. After this, using that user or sharing creds with anyone is not recommended.
- groups can't contain other groups
- there can be users who are not part of any group
- a user can be part of multiple groups
