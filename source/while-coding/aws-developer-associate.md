## IAM:
- IAM is a global service so there is no region to be selected
- first, you create a root account and set up aws account with it. After this, using that user or sharing creds with anyone is not recommended.
### users and groups
- a single user can be part of multiple groups
- there can be users who are not part of any group
- groups can't contain other groups
### IAM policies
- a policy can be applied to a group or an individual user.
- policy applied to individual user is called `inline` policies
