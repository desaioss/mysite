# Java Memory issues

## Tools

As of JDK 17, JDK provides two tools:

- JMC - java mission control
- JFR - java flight recorder

See this for intro of above two tools.

Another good OSS tool that is used by intelliJ in their IDE as well is [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler) 
and learning material [is here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNCLTEx3B8h4Yo_WvKWdLvI9mj1XpTKBr)

Combine these three to analyse memory. 

One of the best paid option is JProfiler.
